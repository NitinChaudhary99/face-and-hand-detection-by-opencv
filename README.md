# Face and Hand Detection using MediaPipe and OpenCV

A real-time face and hand detection system built with Python, MediaPipe, OpenCV, and CVZone. This project demonstrates accurate and efficient tracking of facial features and hand landmarks using your webcam/real time video.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project leverages:
- **MediaPipe** for robust and efficient face/hand landmark detection
- **OpenCV** for image processing and video streaming
- **CVZone** to simplify drawing and interaction logic

Designed for both learning and integration into larger computer vision projects.
